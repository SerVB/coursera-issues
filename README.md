# Coursera Issues
Feedbacks to Coursera support. The list is [under issues tab](https://github.com/SerVB/coursera-issues/issues) (click!).

## What is this?
As Coursera doesn't have any issue tracker, I've decided to store the issues I'm reporting somewhere. This is the place I've chosen.

## How does it work?
All opened issues haven't been solved by Coursera still.

Labels such as `bug` or `enhancement` shows the type of the issue. Take a look at `wontfix` labels: Coursera says they won't make these requested changes.

## How to help?
Feel free to vote for existing issues or create new ones (if you create a new one, don't forget to contact Coursera support via <partner-support@coursera.org> and to specify the date of the contact in the issue title).
